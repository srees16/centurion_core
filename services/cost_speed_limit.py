"""
Cost Speed Limit — Carver Chapter 12 cost-aware trading filter.

Rule: Only trade if expected annual Sharpe ratio contribution
exceeds the cost of trading by a factor of 3:

    cost_per_trade = turnover × (spread + commission + slippage)
    annual_cost = n_trades_per_year × cost_per_trade
    speed_limit_ok = (expected_SR_contribution / annual_cost_drag) > 3

This prevents:
  - Churning low-conviction positions
  - EWMAC(16,64) signals on illiquid mid-caps where spread eats alpha
  - Re-balancing when position inertia should apply

For NSE equities:
  - Brokerage: ~0.03% (₹20 flat cap for Zerodha)
  - STT: 0.1% (on sell delivery)
  - Exchange charges: ~0.00325%
  - GST on brokerage: 18%
  - Stamp duty: 0.015% (buy) / 0.003% (sell)
  - Typical total round-trip: ~0.25-0.35% for delivery trades
  - Estimated spread+slippage: 0.10-0.40% depending on liquidity
