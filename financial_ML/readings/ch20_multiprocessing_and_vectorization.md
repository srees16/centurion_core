# Chapter 20: Multiprocessing and Vectorization


CHAPTER 20
Multiprocessing and Vectorization
20.1
MOTIVATION
Multiprocessing is essential to ML. ML algorithms are computationally intensive,
and they will require an efficient use of all your CPUs, servers, and clusters. For
this reason, most of the functions presented throughout this book were designed
for asynchronous multiprocessing. For example, we have made frequent use of a
mysterious function called mpPandasObj, without ever defining it. In this chap-
ter we will explain what this function does. Furthermore, we will study in detail
how to develop multiprocessing engines. The structure of the programs presented
in this chapter is agnostic to the hardware architecture used to execute them,
whether we employ the cores of a single server or cores distributed across mul-
tiple interconnected servers (e.g., in a high-performance computing cluster or a
cloud).
20.2
VECTORIZATION EXAMPLE
Vectorization, also known as array programming, is the simplest example of paral-
lelization, whereby an operation is applied at once to the entire set of values. As a
minimal example, suppose that you need to do a brute search through a 3-dimensional
space, with 2 nodes per dimension. The un-vectorized implementation of that Carte-
sian product will look something like Snippet 20.1. How would this code look if you
had to search through 100 dimensions, or if the number of dimensions was defined
by the user during runtime?

UN-VECTORIZED CARTESIAN PRODUCT
# Cartesian product of dictionary of lists
dict0={'a':['1','2'],'b':['+','*'],'c':['!','@']}
for a in dict0['a']:
for b in dict0['b']:
for c in dict0['c']:
print {'a':a,'b':b,'c':c}
A vectorized solution would replace all explicit iterators (e.g., For. . .loops)
with matrix algebra operations or compiled iterators or generators. Snippet 20.2
implements the vectorized version of Snippet 20.1. The vectorized version is prefer-
able for four reasons: (1) slow nested For. . .loops are replaced with fast itera-
tors; (2) the code infers the dimensionality of the mesh from the dimensionality of
dict0; (3) we could run 100 dimensions without having to modify the code, or need
100 For. . .loops; and (4) under the hood, Python can run operations in C or
C + + .

SINGLE-THREAD VS. MULTITHREADING VS.
MULTIPROCESSING
A modern computer has multiple CPU sockets. Each CPU has many cores (proces-
sors), and each core has several threads. Multithreading is the technique by which
several applications are run in parallel on two or more threads under the same core.
One advantage of multithreading is that, because the applications share the same core,
they share the same memory space. That introduces the risk that several applications
may write on the same memory space at the same time. To prevent that from hap-
pening, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) assigns write access to one thread per core
at a time. Under the GIL, Python’s multithreading is limited to one thread per pro-
cessor. For this reason, Python achieves parallelism through multiprocessing rather
than through actual multithreading. Processors do not share the same memory space,
hence multiprocessing does not risk writing to the same memory space; however, that
also makes it harder to share objects between processes.


SINGLE-THREAD VS. MULTITHREADING VS. MULTIPROCESSING
305
Python functions implemented for running on a single-thread will use only a frac-
tion of a modern computer’s, server’s, or cluster’s power. Let us see an example of
how a simple task can be run inefficiently when implemented for single-thread exe-
cution. Snippet 20.3 finds the earliest time 10,000 Gaussian processes of length 1,000
touch a symmetric double barrier of width 50 times the standard deviation.
SNIPPET 20.3
SINGLE-THREAD IMPLEMENTATION OF A
ONE-TOUCH DOUBLE BARRIER
import numpy as np
#———————————————————————————————————————
def main0():
# Path dependency: Sequential implementation
r=np.random.normal(0,.01,size=(1000,10000))
t=barrierTouch(r)
return
#———————————————————————————————————————
def barrierTouch(r,width=.5):
# find the index of the earliest barrier touch
t,p={},np.log((1+r).cumprod(axis=0))
for j in xrange(r.shape[1]): # go through columns
for i in xrange(r.shape[0]): # go through rows
if p[i,j]>=width or p[i,j]<=-width:
t[j]=i
break
return t
#———————————————————————————————————————
if __name__=='__main__':
import timeit
print min(timeit.Timer('main0()',setup='from __main__ import main0').repeat(5,10))
Compare this implementation with Snippet 20.4. Now the code splits the previous
problem into 24 tasks, one per processor. The tasks are then run asynchronously in
parallel, using 24 processors. If you run the same code on a cluster with 5000 CPUs,
the elapsed time will be about 1/5000 of the single-thread implementation.

return
#———————————————————————————————————————
if __name__=='__main__':
import timeit
print min(timeit.Timer('main1()',setup='from __main__ import main1').repeat(5,10))
Moreover, you could implement the same code to multiprocess a vectorized func-
tion, as we did with function applyPtSlOnT1 in Chapter 3, where parallel processes
execute subroutines that include vectorized pandas objects. In this way, you will
achieve two levels of parallelization at once. But why stop there? You could achieve
three levels of parallelization at once by running multiprocessed instances of vector-
ized code in an HPC cluster, where each node in the cluster provides the third level
of parallelization. In the next sections, we will explain how multiprocessing works.
20.4
ATOMS AND MOLECULES
When preparing jobs for parallelization, it is useful to distinguish between atoms
and molecules. Atoms are indivisible tasks. Rather than carrying out all these tasks
sequentially in a single thread, we want to group them into molecules, which can be
processed in parallel using multiple processors. Each molecule is a subset of atoms
that will be processed sequentially, by a callback function, using a single thread. Par-
allelization takes place at the molecular level.
20.4.1
Linear Partitions
The simplest way to form molecules is to partition a list of atoms in subsets of equal
size, where the number of subsets is the minimum between the number of processors
and the number of atoms. For N subsets we need to find the N + 1 indices that enclose
the partitions. This logic is demonstrated in Snippet 20.5.
SNIPPET 20.5
THE linParts FUNCTION
import numpy as np
#———————————————————————————————————————
def linParts(numAtoms,numThreads):
# partition of atoms with a single loop
parts=np.linspace(0,numAtoms,min(numThreads,numAtoms)+1)
parts=np.ceil(parts).astype(int)
return parts


ATOMS AND MOLECULES
307
It is common to encounter operations that involve two nested loops. For example,
computing a SADF series (Chapter 17), evaluating multiple barrier touches (Chapter
3), or computing a covariance matrix on misaligned series. In these situations, a linear
partition of the atomic tasks would be inefficient, because some processors would
have to solve a much larger number of operations than others, and the calculation
time will depend on the heaviest molecule. A partial solution is to partition the atomic
tasks in a number of jobs that is a multiple of the number of processors, then front-
load the jobs queue with the heavy molecules. In this way, the light molecules will
be assigned to processors that have completed the heavy molecules first, keeping all
CPUs busy until the job queue is depleted. In the next section, we will discuss a more
complete solution. Figure 20.1 plots a linear partition of 20 atomic tasks of equal
complexity into 6 molecules.
20.4.2
Two-Nested Loops Partitions
Consider
two
nested
loops,
where
the
outer
loop
iterates
i = 1, … , N
and the inner loop iterates j = 1, … , i. We can order these atomic tasks
{(i, j)|1 ≤j ≤i, i = 1, … , N} as a lower triangular matrix (including the main
diagonal). This entails 1
2N(N −1) + N = 1
2N(N + 1) operations, where 1
2N(N −1)
are off-diagonal and N are diagonal. We would like to parallelize these tasks by
partitioning the atomic tasks into M subsets of rows, {Sm}m=1,…,M, each composed
of approximately
1
2M N(N + 1) tasks. The following algorithm determines the rows
that constitute each subset (a molecule).

MULTIPROCESSING AND VECTORIZATION
The first subset, S1, is composed of the first r1 rows, that is, S1 = {1, … , r1}, for a
total number of items 1
2r1(r1 + 1). Then, r1 must satisfy the condition 1
2r1(r1 + 1) =
1
2M N(N + 1). Solving for r1, we obtain the positive root
r1 = −1 +
√
1 + 4N(N + 1)M−1
2
The second subset contains rows S2 = {r1 + 1, … , r2}, for a total number of items
1
2(r2 + r1 + 1)(r2 −r1). Then, r2 must satisfy the condition 1
2(r2 + r1 + 1)(r2 −r1) =
1
2M N(N + 1). Solving for r2, we obtain the positive root
r2 =
−1 +
√
1 + 4(r2
1 + r1 + N(N + 1)M−1)
2
We can repeat the same argument for a future subset Sm = {rm−1 + 1, … , rm},
with a total number of items 1
2(rm + rm−1 + 1)(rm −rm−1). Then, rm must satisfy the
condition 1
2(rm + rm−1 + 1)(rm −rm−1) =
1
2M N(N + 1). Solving for rm, we obtain the
positive root
rm =
−1 +
√
1 + 4(r2
m−1 + rm−1 + N(N + 1)M−1)
2
And it is easy to see that rm reduces to r1 where rm−1 = r0 = 0. Because row num-
bers are positive integers, the above results are rounded to the nearest natural number.
This may mean that some partitions’ sizes may deviate slightly from the
1
2MN(N + 1)
target. Snippet 20.6 implements this logic.

if upperTriang: # the first rows are the heaviest

FIGURE 20.2
A two-nested loops partition of atoms into molecules
If the outer loop iterates i = 1, … , N and the inner loop iterates j = i, … , N, we can
order these atomic tasks {(i, j) |1 ≤i ≤j , j = 1, … , N} as an upper triangular matrix
(including the main diagonal). In this case, the argument upperTriang= True must
be passed to function nestedParts. For the curious reader, this is a special case of
the bin packing problem. Figure 20.2 plots a two-nested loops partition of atoms of
increasing complexity into molecules. Each of the resulting 6 molecules involves a
similar amount of work, even though some atomic tasks are up to 20 times harder
than others.
20.5
MULTIPROCESSING ENGINES
It would be a mistake to write a parallelization wrapper for each multiprocessed func-
tion. Instead, we should develop a library that can parallelize unknown functions,
regardless of their arguments and output structure. That is the goal of a multiprocess-
ing engine. In this section, we will study one such engine, and once you understand
the logic, you will be ready to develop your own, including all sorts of customized
properties.
20.5.1
Preparing the Jobs
In previous chapters we have made frequent use of the mpPandasObj. That function
receives six arguments, of which four are optional:


310
MULTIPROCESSING AND VECTORIZATION
r func: A callback function, which will be executed in parallel
r pdObj: A tuple containing:
◦The name of the argument used to pass molecules to the callback function
◦A list of indivisible tasks (atoms), which will be grouped into molecules
r numThreads: The number of threads that will be used in parallel (one processor
per thread)
r mpBatches: Number of parallel batches (jobs per core)
r linMols: Whether partitions will be linear or double-nested
r kargs: Keyword arguments needed by func
Snippet 20.7 lists how mpPandasObj works. First, atoms are grouped into
molecules, using linParts (equal number of atoms per molecule) or nestedParts
(atoms distributed in a lower-triangular structure). When mpBatches is greater than
1, there will be more molecules than cores. Suppose that we divide a task into 10
molecules, where molecule 1 takes twice as long as the rest. If we run this process in
10 cores, 9 of the cores will be idle half of the runtime, waiting for the first core to pro-
cess molecule 1. Alternatively, we could set mpBatches=10 so as to divide that task
in 100 molecules. In doing so, every core will receive equal workload, even though
the first 10 molecules take as much time as the next 20 molecules. In this example,
the run with mpBatches=10 will take half of the time consumed by mpBatches=1.
Second, we form a list of jobs. A job is a dictionary containing all the informa-
tion needed to process a molecule, that is, the callback function, its keyword argu-
ments, and the subset of atoms that form the molecule. Third, we will process the
jobs sequentially if numThreads==1 (see Snippet 20.8), and in parallel otherwise
(see Section 20.5.2). The reason that we want the option to run jobs sequentially is
for debugging purposes. It is not easy to catch a bug when programs are run in mul-
tiple processors.1 Once the code is debugged, we will want to use numThreads > 1.
Fourth, we stitch together the output from every molecule into a single list, series, or
dataframe.

Asynchronous Calls
Python has a parallelization library called multiprocessing. This library is the
basis for multiprocessing engines such as joblib,2 which is the engine used by
many sklearn algorithms.3 Snippet 20.9 illustrates how to do an asynchronous call
to Python’s multiprocessing library. The reportProgress function keeps us
informed about the percentage of jobs completed.

20.5.3
Unwrapping the Callback
In Snippet 20.9, the instruction pool.imap_unordered() parallelized expand-
Call, by running each item in jobs (a molecule) in a single thread. Snippet 20.10
lists expandCall, which unwraps the items (atoms) in the job (molecule), and exe-
cutes the callback function. This little function is the trick at the core of the multipro-
cessing engine: It transforms a dictionary into a task. Once you understand the role
it plays, you will be able to develop your own engines.

Pickle/Unpickle Objects
Multiprocessing must pickle methods in order to assign them to different processors.
The problem is, bound methods are not pickleable. The work around is to add func-
4
tionality to your engine, that tells the library how to deal with this kind of objects.
Snippet 20.11 contains the instructions that should be listed at the top of your mul-
tiprocessing engine library. If you are curious about the precise reason this piece of
code is needed, you may want to read Ascher et al. [2005], Section 7.5.

20.5.5
Output Reduction
Suppose that you divide a task into 24 molecules, with the goal that the engine assigns
each molecule to one available core. Function processJobs in Snippet 20.9 will
capture the 24 outputs and store them in a list. This approach is effective in problems
that do not involve large outputs. If the outputs must be combined into a single output,
first we will wait until the last molecule is completed, and then we will process the
items in the list. The latency added by this post-processing should not be significant,
as long as the outputs are small in size and number.
However, when the outputs consume a lot of RAM, and they need to be combined
into a single output, storing all those outputs in a list may cause a memory error. It
would be better to perform the output reduction operation on the fly, as the results
are returned asynchronously by func, rather than waiting for the last molecule to
be completed. We can address this concern by improving processJobs. In particular,

multiprocessing-pool-ma.


314
MULTIPROCESSING AND VECTORIZATION
we are going to pass three additional arguments that determine how the molecular
outputs must be reduced into a single output. Snippet 20.12 lists an enhanced version
of processJobs, which contains three new arguments:
r redux: This is a callback to the function that carries out the reduction.
For example, redux= pd.DataFrame.add, if output dataframes ought to be
summed up.
r reduxArgs: This is a dictionary that contains the keyword arguments that must
be passed to redux (if any). For example, if redux= pd.DataFrame.join,
then a possibility is reduxArgs={'how':'outer'}.
r reduxInPlace: A boolean, indicating whether the
redux operation
should happen in-place or not. For example, redux= dict.update and
redux= list.append require reduxInPlace= True, since appending a list
and updating a dictionary are both in-place operations.

Now that processJobsRedux knows what to do with the outputs, we can also
enhance mpPandasObj from Snippet 20.7. In Snippet 20.13, the new function
mpJobList passes the three output reduction arguments to processJobsRedux.

MULTIPROCESSING EXAMPLE
What we have presented so far in this chapter can be used to speed-up, by several
orders of magnitude, many lengthy and large-scale mathematical operations. In this
section we will illustrate an additional motivation for multiprocessing: memory man-
agement.
Suppose that you have conducted a spectral decomposition of a covariance matrix
of the form Z′Z, as we did in Chapter 8, Section 8.4.2, where Z has size TxN. This
has resulted in an eigenvectors matrix W and an eigenvalues matrix Λ, such that
Z′ZW = WΛ. Now you would like to derive the orthogonal principal components
that explain a user-defined portion of the total variance, 0 ≤𝜏≤1. In order to do
that, we compute P = Z ̃W, where ̃W contains the first M ≤N columns of W, such that
(∑M
m=1 Λm,m)(∑N
n=1 Λn,n)−1 ≥𝜏. The computation of P = Z ̃W can be parallelized by
noting that
P = Z ̃W =
B
∑
b=1
Zb ̃Wb
where Zb is a sparse TxN matrix with only TxNb items (the rest are empty), ̃Wb is a
NxM matrix with only NbxM items (the rest are empty), and ∑B
b=1 Nb = N. This spar-
sity is created by dividing the set of columns into a partition of B subsets of columns,
and loading into Zb only the bth subset of the columns. This notion of sparsity may
sound a bit complicated at first, however Snippet 20.14 demonstrates how pandas


316
MULTIPROCESSING AND VECTORIZATION
allows us to implement it in a seamless way. Function getPCs receives ̃W through
the argument eVec. The argument molecules contains a subset of the file names in
fileNames, where each file represents Zb. The key concept to grasp is that we compute
the dot product of a Zb with the slice of the rows of ̃Wb defined by the columns in Zb,
and that molecular results are aggregated on the fly (redux= pd.DataFrame.add).

df0=pd.read_csv(path+i,index_col=0,parse_dates=True)
if pcs is None:pcs=np.dot(df0.values,eVec.loc[df0.columns].values)
else:pcs+=np.dot(df0.values,eVec.loc[df0.columns].values)
pcs=pd.DataFrame(pcs,index=df0.index,columns=eVec.columns)
return pcs
This approach presents two advantages: First, because getPCs loads dataframes
Zb sequentially, for a sufficiently large B, the RAM is not exhausted. Second, mpJob-
List executes the molecules in parallel, hence speeding up the calculations.
In real life ML applications, we often encounter datasets where Z contains billions
of datapoints. As this example demonstrates, parallelization is not only beneficial in
terms of reducing run time. Many problems could not be solved without paralleliza-
tion, as a matter of memory limitations, even if we were willing to wait longer.
EXERCISES
20.1 Run Snippets 20.1 and 20.2 with timeit. Repeat 10 batches of 100 executions.
What is the minimum elapsed time for each snippet?
20.2 The instructions in Snippet 20.2 are very useful for unit testing, brute force
searches, and scenario analysis. Can you remember where else in the book have
you seen them? Where else could they have been used?
20.3 Adjust Snippet 20.4 to form molecules using a two-nested loops scheme, rather
than a linear scheme.
20.4 Compare with timeit:
(a) Snippet 20.4, by repeating 10 batches of 100 executions. What is the mini-
mum elapsed time for each snippet?

(b) Modify Snippet 20.4 (from exercise 3), by repeating 10 batches of 100 exe-
cutions. What is the minimum elapsed time for each snippet?
20.5 Simplify Snippet 20.4 by using mpPandasObj.
20.6 Modify mpPandasObj to handle the possibility of forming molecules using a
two-nested loops scheme with an upper triangular structure.
