# Chapter 14: Backtest Statistics


CHAPTER 14
Backtest Statistics
14.1
MOTIVATION
In the previous chapters, we have studied three backtesting paradigms: First, histor-
ical simulations (the walk-forward method, Chapters 11 and 12). Second, scenario
simulations (CV and CPCV methods, Chapter 12). Third, simulations on synthetic
data (Chapter 13). Regardless of the backtesting paradigm you choose, you need to
report the results according to a series of statistics that investors will use to compare
and judge your strategy against competitors. In this chapter we will discuss some
of the most commonly used performance evaluation statistics. Some of these statis-
tics are included in the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS),1 however a
comprehensive analysis of performance requires metrics specific to the ML strategies
under scrutiny.
14.2
TYPES OF BACKTEST STATISTICS
Backtest statistics comprise metrics used by investors to assess and compare various
investment strategies. They should help us uncover potentially problematic aspects of
the strategy, such as substantial asymmetric risks or low capacity. Overall, they can be
categorized into general characteristics, performance, runs/drawdowns, implementa-
tion shortfall, return/risk efficiency, classification scores, and attribution.

BACKTEST STATISTICS
14.3
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS
The following statistics inform us about the general characteristics of the backtest:
r Time range: Time range specifies the start and end dates. The period used to
test the strategy should be sufficiently long to include a comprehensive number
of regimes (Bailey and L´opez de Prado [2012]).
r Average AUM: This is the average dollar value of the assets under manage-
ment. For the purpose of computing this average, the dollar value of long and
short positions is considered to be a positive real number.
r Capacity: A strategy’s capacity can be measured as the highest AUM that deliv-
ers a target risk-adjusted performance. A minimum AUM is needed to ensure
proper bet sizing (Chapter 10) and risk diversification (Chapter 16). Beyond
that minimum AUM, performance will decay as AUM increases, due to higher
transaction costs and lower turnover.
r Leverage: Leverage measures the amount of borrowing needed to achieve the
reported performance. If leverage takes place, costs must be assigned to it. One
way to measure leverage is as the ratio of average dollar position size to average
AUM.
r Maximum dollar position size: Maximum dollar position size informs us
whether the strategy at times took dollar positions that greatly exceeded the
average AUM. In general we will prefer strategies that take maximum dollar
positions close to the average AUM, indicating that they do not rely on the
occurrence of extreme events (possibly outliers).
r Ratio of longs: The ratio of longs show what proportion of the bets involved
long positions. In long-short, market neutral strategies, ideally this value is close
to 0.5. If not, the strategy may have a position bias, or the backtested period may
be too short and unrepresentative of future market conditions.
r Frequency of bets: The frequency of bets is the number of bets per year in
the backtest. A sequence of positions on the same side is considered part of the
same bet. A bet ends when the position is flattened or flipped to the opposite
side. The number of bets is always smaller than the number of trades. A trade
count would overestimate the number of independent opportunities discovered
by the strategy.
r Average holding period: The average holding period is the average number of
days a bet is held. High-frequency strategies may hold a position for a fraction
of seconds, whereas low frequency strategies may hold a position for months
or even years. Short holding periods may limit the capacity of the strategy. The
holding period is related but different to the frequency of bets. For example,
a strategy may place bets on a monthly basis, around the release of nonfarm
payrolls data, where each bet is held for only a few minutes.
r Annualized turnover: Annualized turnover measures the ratio of the average
dollar amount traded per year to the average annual AUM. High turnover may
occur even with a low number of bets, as the strategy may require constant
tuning of the position. High turnover may also occur with a low number of

trades, if every trade involves flipping the position between maximum long and
maximum short.
r Correlation to underlying: This is the correlation between strategy returns
and the returns of the underlying investment universe. When the correlation is
significantly positive or negative, the strategy is essentially holding or short-
selling the investment universe, without adding much value.
Snippet 14.1 lists an algorithm that derives the timestamps of flattening or flipping
trades from a pandas series of target positions (tPos). This gives us the number of
bets that have taken place.

PERFORMANCE
Performance statistics are dollar and returns numbers without risk adjustments. Some
useful performance measurements include:
r PnL: The total amount of dollars (or the equivalent in the currency of denom-
ination) generated over the entirety of the backtest, including liquidation costs
from the terminal position.
r PnL from long positions: The portion of the PnL dollars that was generated
exclusively by long positions. This is an interesting value for assessing the bias
of long-short, market neutral strategies.
r Annualized rate of return: The time-weighted average annual rate of total
return, including dividends, coupons, costs, etc.
r Hit ratio: The fraction of bets that resulted in a positive PnL.
r Average return from hits: The average return from bets that generated a profit.
r Average return from misses: The average return from bets that generated a
loss.
14.4.1
Time-Weighted Rate of Return
Total return is the rate of return from realized and unrealized gains and losses,
including accrued interest, paid coupons, and dividends for the measurement
period. GIPS rules calculate time-weighted rate of returns (TWRR), adjusted for
external flows (CFA Institute [2010]). Periodic and sub-periodic returns are
geometrically linked. For periods beginning on or after January 1, 2005, GIPS
rules mandate calculating portfolio returns that adjust for daily-weighted external
flows.
We can compute the TWRR by determining the value of the portfolio at the time
of each external flow.
The TWRR for portfolio

is denoted ri,t, with equations
ri,t =
𝜋i,t

𝜋i,t =

r 𝜋i,t is the mark-to-market (MtM) profit or loss for portfolio i at time t.
r Ki,t is the market value of the assets under management by portfolio i through
subperiod t. The purpose of including the max {.} term is to fund additional
purchases (ramp-up).
r Aj,t is the interest accrued or dividend paid by one unit of instrument j at time t.
r Pj,t is the clean price of security j at time t.
r 𝜃i,j,t are the holdings of portfolio i on security j at time t.
r ̃Pj,t is the dirty price of security j at time t.

geometrically as

∏

(1 + ri,t)
The variable 𝜑i,T can be understood as the performance of one dollar invested in
portfolio i over its entire life, t = 1, … , T. Finally, the annualized rate of return of
portfolio i is
Ri = (𝜑i,T)−yi −1
where yi is the number of years elapsed between ri,1 and ri,T.
14.5
RUNS
Investment strategies rarely generate returns drawn from an IID process. In the
absence of this property, strategy returns series exhibit frequent runs. Runs are unin-
terrupted sequences of returns of the same sign. Consequently, runs increase down-
side risk, which needs to be evaluated with proper metrics.
14.5.1
Returns Concentration
Given a time series of returns from bets, {rt}t=1,…,T, we compute two weight series,
w−and w+:
r+ = {rt|rt ≥0}t=1,…,T
r−= {rt|rt < 0}t=1,…,T
Inflows are assumed to occur at the beginning of the day, and outflows are

Inspired by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), for ||w+|| > 1, where ||.|| is the
size of the vector, we define the concentration of positive returns as

From Jensen’s inequality, we know that E[r+
t ]2 ≤E[(r+
t )2]. And because
E[(r+
t )2]
E[r+
t ]2 ≤
||r+||, we deduce that E[r+
t ]2 ≤E[(r+
t )2] ≤E[r+
t ]2||r+||, with an equivalent bound-
ary on negative bet returns. These definitions have a few interesting properties:
1. 0 ≤h+ ≤1
2. h+ = 0 ⇔w+
t = ||w+||−1, ∀t (uniform returns)
3. h+ = 1 ⇔∃i|w+
i = ∑
t w+
t (only one non-zero return)
It is easy to derive a similar expression for the concentration of bets across months,
h [t]. Snippet 14.3 implements these concepts. Ideally, we are interested in strategies
where bets’ returns exhibit:
r high Sharpe ratio
r high number of bets per year, ||r+|| + ||r−|| = T
r high hit ratio (relatively low ||r−||)
r low h+ (no right fat-tail)
r low h−(no left fat-tail)
r low h [t] (bets are not concentrated in time)

Drawdown and Time under Water
Intuitively, a drawdown (DD) is the maximum loss suffered by an investment between
two consecutive high-watermarks (HWMs). The time under water (TuW) is the time
elapsed between an HWM and the moment the PnL exceeds the previous maximum
PnL. These concepts are best understood by reading Snippet 14.4. This code derives
both DD and TuW series from either (1) the series of returns (dollars= False)
or; (2) the series of dollar performance (dollar= True). Figure 14.1 provides an
example of DD and TuW.

IMPLEMENTATION SHORTFALL
Investment strategies often fail due to wrong assumptions regarding execution costs.
Some important measurements of this include:
r Broker fees per turnover: These are the fees paid to the broker for turning the
portfolio over, including exchange fees.
r Average slippage per turnover: These are execution costs, excluding broker
fees, involved in one portfolio turnover. For example, it includes the loss caused
by buying a security at a fill-price higher than the mid-price at the moment the
order was sent to the execution broker.
r Dollar performance per turnover: This is the ratio between dollar per-
formance (including brokerage fees and slippage costs) and total portfolio
turnovers. It signifies how much costlier the execution could become before
the strategy breaks even.


EFFICIENCY
203
r Return on execution costs: This is the ratio between dollar performance
(including brokerage fees and slippage costs) and total execution costs. It should
be a large multiple, to ensure that the strategy will survive worse-than-expected
execution.
14.7
EFFICIENCY
Until now, all performance statistics considered profits, losses, and costs. In this sec-
tion, we account for the risks involved in achieving those results.
14.7.1
The Sharpe Ratio
Suppose that a strategy’s excess returns (in excess of the risk-free rate), {rt}t=1,…,T,
are IID Gaussian with mean 𝜇and variance 𝜎2. The Sharpe ratio (SR) is defined as
SR = 𝜇
𝜎
The purpose of SR is to evaluate the skills of a particular strategy or investor.
Since 𝜇, 𝜎are usually unknown, the true SR value cannot be known for certain. The
inevitable consequence is that Sharpe ratio calculations may be the subject of sub-
stantial estimation errors.
14.7.2
The Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio
The probabilistic Sharpe ratio (PSR) provides an adjusted estimate of SR, by remov-
ing the inflationary effect caused by short series with skewed and/or fat-tailed returns.
Given a user-defined benchmark3 Sharpe ratio (SR∗) and an observed Sharpe ratio ̂
SR,
PSR estimates the probability that ̂
SR is greater than a hypothetical SR∗. Following
Bailey and L´opez de Prado [2012], PSR can be estimated as
̂
PSR [SR∗] = Z

where Z [.] is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard Normal dis-
tribution, T is the number of observed returns, ̂𝛾3 is the skewness of the returns, and
̂𝛾4 is the kurtosis of the returns (̂𝛾4 = 3 for Gaussian returns). For a given SR∗, ̂
PSR
increases with greater ̂
SR (in the original sampling frequency, i.e. non-annualized), or
longer track records (T), or positively skewed returns (̂𝛾3), but it decreases with fatter

tails (̂𝛾4). Figure 14.2 plots ̂

̂𝛾3 and T.
14.7.3
The Deflated Sharpe Ratio
The deflated Sharpe ratio (DSR) is a PSR where the rejection threshold is adjusted to
reflect the multiplicity of trials. Following Bailey and L´opez de Prado [2014], DSR
can be estimated as ̂
PSR [SR∗], where the benchmark Sharpe ratio, SR∗, is no longer
user-defined. Instead, SR∗is estimated as
SR∗=
√
V
[{
̂
SRn
}] (
(1 −𝛾) Z−1 [
1 −1
N
]
+ 𝛾Z−1 [

where V[{̂
SRn}] is the variance across the trials’ estimated SR, N is the number
of independent trials, Z [.] is the CDF of the standard Normal distribution, 𝛾is the
Euler-Mascheroni constant, and n = 1, … , N. Figure 14.3 plots SR∗as a function of
V[{̂
SRn}] and N.
The rationale behind DSR is the following: Given a set of SR estimates, {̂
SRn},
its expected maximum is greater than zero, even if the true SR is zero. Under the
null hypothesis that the actual Sharpe ratio is zero, H0 : SR = 0, we know that the
expected maximum ̂
SR can be estimated as the SR∗. Indeed, SR∗increases quickly
as more independent trials are attempted (N), or the trials involve a greater variance
(V[{̂
SRn}]). From this knowledge we derive the third law of backtesting.

“Every backtest result must be reported in conjunction with all the trials

the backtest’s ‘false discovery’ probability.”

14.7.4
Efficiency Statistics
Useful efficiency statistics include:
r Annualized Sharpe ratio: This is the SR value, annualized by a factor
√
a,
where a is the average number of returns observed per year. This common annu-
alization method relies on the assumption that returns are IID.
r Information ratio: This is the SR equivalent of a portfolio that measures its per-
formance relative to a benchmark. It is the annualized ratio between the average
excess return and the tracking error. The excess return is measured as the portfo-
lio’s return in excess of the benchmark’s return. The tracking error is estimated
as the standard deviation of the excess returns.
r Probabilistic Sharpe ratio: PSR corrects SR for inflationary effects caused
by non-Normal returns or track record length. It should exceed 0.95, for the

standard significance level of 5%. It can be computed on absolute or relative
returns.
r Deflated Sharpe ratio: DSR corrects SR for inflationary effects caused by
non-Normal returns, track record length, and selection bias under multiple testing.
It should exceed 0.95, for the standard significance level of 5%. It can be com-
puted on absolute or relative returns.
14.8
CLASSIFICATION SCORES
In the context of meta-labeling strategies (Chapter 3, Section 3.6), it is useful to
understand the performance of the ML overlay algorithm in isolation. Remember that
the primary algorithm identifies opportunities, and the secondary (overlay) algorithm
decides whether to pursue them or pass. A few useful statistics include:
r Accuracy: Accuracy is the fraction of opportunities correctly labeled by the
overlay algorithm,
accuracy =
TP + TN
TP + TN + FP + FN
where TP is the number of true positives, TN is the number of true negatives,
FP is the number of false positives, and FN is the number of false negatives.
r Precision: Precision is the fraction of true positives among the predicted
positives,
precision =
TP
TP + FP
r Recall: Recall is the fraction of true positives among the positives,
recall =
TP
TP + FN
r F1: Accuracy may not be an adequate classification score for meta-labeling
applications. Suppose that, after you apply meta-labeling, there are many more
negative cases (label ‘0’) than positive cases (label ‘1’). Under that scenario, a
classifier that predicts every case to be negative will achieve high accuracy, even
though recall=0 and precision is undefined. The F1 score corrects for that flaw,
by assessing the classifier in terms of the (equally weighted) harmonic mean of
precision and recall,
F1 = 2 precision ⋅recall
precision + recall
As a side note, consider the unusual scenario where, after applying meta-
labeling, there are many more positive cases than negative cases. A classi-
fier that predicts all cases to be positive will achieve TN=0 and FN=0, hence
accuracy=precision and recall=1. Accuracy will be high, and F1 will not be
smaller than accuracy, even though the classifier is not able to discriminate
between the observed samples. One solution would be to switch the definitions


ATTRIBUTION

of positive and negative cases, so that negative cases are predominant, and then
score with F1.
r Negative log-loss: Negative log-loss was introduced in Chapter 9, Section 9.4,
in the context of hyper-parameter tuning. Please refer to that section for details.
The key conceptual difference between accuracy and negative log-loss is that
negative log-loss takes into account not only whether our predictions were cor-
rect or not, but the probability of those predictions as well.
See Chapter 3, Section 3.7 for a visual representation of precision, recall, and
accuracy. Table 14.1 characterizes the four degenerate cases of binary classification.
As you can see, the F1 score is not defined in two of those cases. For this reason,
when Scikit-learn is asked to compute F1 on a sample with no observed 1s or with
no predicted 1s, it will print a warning (UndefinedMetricWarning), and set the F1
value to 0.

When all observed values are positive (label ‘1’), there are no true negatives or
false positives, thus precision is 1, recall is a positive real number between 0 and 1
(inclusive), and accuracy equals recall. Then, F1 = 2 recall
1+recall ≥recall.

14.9
ATTRIBUTION
The purpose of performance attribution is to decompose the PnL in terms of risk
classes. For example, a corporate bond portfolio manager typically wants to under-
stand how much of its performance comes from his exposure to the following risks
classes: duration, credit, liquidity, economic sector, currency, sovereign, issuer, etc.
Did his duration bets pay off? What credit segments does he excel at? Or should he
focus on his issuer selection skills?
These risks are not orthogonal, so there is always an overlap between them. For
example, highly liquid bonds tend to have short durations and high credit rating, and
are normally issued by large entities with large amounts outstanding, in U.S. dollars.
As a result, the sum of the attributed PnLs will not match the total PnL, but at least we
will be able to compute the Sharpe ratio (or information ratio) per risk class. Perhaps
the most popular example of this approach is Barra’s multi-factor method. See Barra
[1998, 2013] and Zhang and Rachev [2004] for details.


208
BACKTEST STATISTICS
Of equal interest is to attribute PnL across categories within each class. For exam-
ple, the duration class could be split between short duration (less than 5 years),
medium duration (between 5 and 10 years), and long duration (in excess of 10 years).
This PnL attribution can be accomplished as follows: First, to avoid the overlapping
problem we referred to earlier, we need to make sure that each member of the invest-
ment universe belongs to one and only one category of each risk class at any point in
time. In other words, for each risk class, we split the entire investment universe into
disjoint partitions. Second, for each risk class, we form one index per risk category.
For example, we will compute the performance of an index of short duration bonds,
another index of medium duration bonds, and another index of long duration bonds.
The weightings for each index are the re-scaled weights of our investment portfolio,
so that each index’s weightings add up to one. Third, we repeat the second step, but
this time we form those risk category indices using the weights from the investment
universe (e.g., Markit iBoxx Investment Grade), again re-scaled so that each index’s
weightings add up to one. Fourth, we compute the performance metrics we discussed
earlier in the chapter on each of these indices’ returns and excess returns. For the sake
of clarity, in this context the excess return of a short duration index is the return using
(re-scaled) portfolio weightings (step 2) minus the return using (re-scaled) universe
weightings (step 3).

(j) Information ratio, where the benchmark is the risk-free rate.
(k) PSR.
(l) DSR, where we assume there were 100 trials, and the variance of the trials’
SR was 0.5.
14.3 Consider a strategy that is long one futures contract on even years, and is short
one futures contract on odd years.
(a) Repeat the calculations from exercise 2.
(b) What is the correlation to the underlying?

14.4 The results from a 2-year backtest are that monthly returns have a mean of 3.6%,
and a standard deviation of 0.079%.
(a) What is the SR?
(b) What is the annualized SR?
14.5 Following on exercise 4:
(a) The returns have a skewness of 0 and a kurtosis of 3. What is the PSR?
(b) The returns have a skewness of -2.448 and a kurtosis of 10.164. What is the
PSR?
14.6 What would be the PSR from 2.b, if the backtest had been for a length of 3 years?
14.7 A 5-year backtest has an annualized SR of 2.5, computed on daily returns. The
skewness is -3 and the kurtosis is 10.
(a) What is the PSR?
(b) In order to find that best result, 100 trials were conducted. The variance of
the Sharpe ratios on those trials is 0.5. What is the DSR?
