# Chapter 8: Feature Importance


CHAPTER 8
Feature Importance
8.1
MOTIVATION
One of the most pervasive mistakes in financial research is to take some data, run
it through an ML algorithm, backtest the predictions, and repeat the sequence until
a nice-looking backtest shows up. Academic journals are filled with such pseudo-
discoveries, and even large hedge funds constantly fall into this trap. It does not matter
if the backtest is a walk-forward out-of-sample. The fact that we are repeating a test
over and over on the same data will likely lead to a false discovery. This methodolog-
ical error is so notorious among statisticians that they consider it scientific fraud, and
the American Statistical Association warns against it in its ethical guidelines (Amer-
ican Statistical Association [2016], Discussion #4). It typically takes about 20 such
iterations to discover a (false) investment strategy subject to the standard significance
level (false positive rate) of 5%. In this chapter we will explore why such an approach
is a waste of time and money, and how feature importance offers an alternative.
8.2
THE IMPORTANCE OF FEATURE IMPORTANCE
A striking facet of the financial industry is that so many very seasoned portfolio
managers (including many with a quantitative background) do not realize how easy
it is to overfit a backtest. How to backtest properly is not the subject of this chapter;
we will address that extremely important topic in Chapters 11–15. The goal of this
chapter is to explain one of the analyses that must be performed before any backtest
is carried out.
Suppose that you are given a pair of matrices (X, y), that respectively contain
features and labels for a particular financial instrument. We can fit a classifier on
(X, y) and evaluate the generalization error through a purged k-fold cross-validation
(CV), as we saw in Chapter 7. Suppose that we achieve good performance. The next

FEATURE IMPORTANCE
natural question is to try to understand what features contributed to that performance.
Maybe we could add some features that strengthen the signal responsible for the clas-
sifier’s predictive power. Maybe we could eliminate some of the features that are only
adding noise to the system. Notably, understanding feature importance opens up the
proverbial black box. We can gain insight into the patterns identified by the classifier
if we understand what source of information is indispensable to it. This is one of the
reasons why the black box mantra is somewhat overplayed by the ML skeptics. Yes,
the algorithm has learned without us directing the process (that is the whole point
of ML!) in a black box, but that does not mean that we cannot (or should not) take
a look at what the algorithm has found. Hunters do not blindly eat everything their
smart dogs retrieve for them, do they?
Once we have found what features are important, we can learn more by conducting
a number of experiments. Are these features important all the time, or only in some
specific environments? What triggers a change in importance over time? Can those
regime switches be predicted? Are those important features also relevant to other
related financial instruments? Are they relevant to other asset classes? What are the
most relevant features across all financial instruments? What is the subset of features
with the highest rank correlation across the entire investment universe? This is a much
better way of researching strategies than the foolish backtest cycle. Let me state this
maxim as one of the most critical lessons I hope you learn from this book:

FEATURE IMPORTANCE WITH SUBSTITUTION EFFECTS
I find it useful to distinguish between feature importance methods based on whether
they are impacted by substitution effects. In this context, a substitution effect takes
place when the estimated importance of one feature is reduced by the presence of
other related features. Substitution effects are the ML analogue of what the statistics
and econometrics literature calls “multi-collinearity.” One way to address linear sub-
stitution effects is to apply PCA on the raw features, and then perform the feature
importance analysis on the orthogonal features. See Belsley et al. [1980], Goldberger
[1991, pp. 245–253], and Hill et al. [2001] for further details.
8.3.1
Mean Decrease Impurity
Mean decrease impurity (MDI) is a fast, explanatory-importance (in-sample, IS)
method specific to tree-based classifiers, like RF. At each node of each decision
tree, the selected feature splits the subset it received in such a way that impurity is

decreased. Therefore, we can derive for each decision tree how much of the overall
impurity decrease can be assigned to each feature. And given that we have a forest of
trees, we can average those values across all estimators and rank the features accord-
ingly. See Louppe et al. [2013] for a detailed description. There are some important
considerations you must keep in mind when working with MDI:
1. Masking effects take place when some features are systematically ignored
by tree-based classifiers in favor of others. In order to avoid them, set
max_features=int(1)when using sklearn’s RF class. In this way, only one
random feature is considered per level.
(a) Every feature is given a chance (at some random levels of some random
trees) to reduce impurity.
(b) Make sure that features with zero importance are not averaged, since the
only reason for a 0 is that the feature was not randomly chosen. Replace
those values with np.nan.
2. The procedure is obviously IS. Every feature will have some importance, even
if they have no predictive power whatsoever.
3. MDI cannot be generalized to other non-tree based classifiers.
4. By construction, MDI has the nice property that feature importances add up to
1, and every feature importance is bounded between 0 and 1.
5. The method does not address substitution effects in the presence of codependent
features. MDI dilutes the importance of substitute features, because of their
interchangeability: The importance of two identical features will be halved, as
they are randomly chosen with equal probability.
6. Strobl et al. [2007] show experimentally that MDI is biased towards some pre-
dictor variables. White and Liu [1994] argue that, in case of single decision
trees, this bias is due to an unfair advantage given by popular impurity func-
tions toward predictors with a large number of categories.
Sklearn’s RandomForest class implements MDI as the default feature impor-
tance score. This choice is likely motivated by the ability to compute MDI on the
fly, with minimum computational cost.1 Snippet 8.2 illustrates an implementation of
MDI, incorporating the considerations listed earlier.

8.3.2
Mean Decrease Accuracy
Mean decrease accuracy (MDA) is a slow, predictive-importance (out-of-sample,
OOS) method. First, it fits a classifier; second, it derives its performance OOS accord-
ing to some performance score (accuracy, negative log-loss, etc.); third, it permutates
(i.e., shuffles) each column of the features matrix (X), one column at a time,
deriving the perfor-mance OOS after each column’s permutation. The importance
of a feature is a func-tion of the loss in performance caused by its column’s
permutation. Some relevant considerations include:
1. This method can be applied to any classifier, not only tree-based classifiers.
2. MDA is not limited to accuracy as the sole performance score. For example,
in the context of meta-labeling applications, we may prefer to score a classifier
with F1 rather than accuracy (see Chapter 14, Section 14.8 for an explanation).
That is one reason a better descriptive name would have been “permutation
importance.” When the scoring function does not correspond to a metric space,
MDA results should be used as a ranking.
3. Like MDI, the procedure is also susceptible to substitution effects in the pres-
ence of codependent features. Given two identical features, shuffling one
still allows the other one to contribute to the prediction, hence giving the false
impression that both features are less important than they truly are.
4. Unlike MDI, it is possible that MDA concludes that all features are unimpor-
tant. That is because MDA is based on OOS performance.
5. The CV must be purged and embargoed, for the reasons explained in Chapter 7.
Snippet 8.3 implements MDA feature importance with sample weights, with
purged k-fold CV, and with scoring by negative log-loss or accuracy. It measures
MDA importance as a function of the improvement (from permutating to not permu-
tating the feature), relative to the maximum possible score (negative log-loss of 0, or
accuracy of 1). Note that, in some cases, the improvement may be negative, meaning
that the feature is actually detrimental to the forecasting power of the ML algorithm.

FEATURE IMPORTANCE WITHOUT SUBSTITUTION EFFECTS
Substitution effects can lead us to discard important features that happen to be redun-
dant. This is not generally a problem in the context of prediction, but it could lead
us to wrong conclusions when we are trying to understand, improve, or simplify a
model. For this reason, the following single feature importance method can be a good
complement to MDI and MDA.
8.4.1
Single Feature Importance
Single feature importance (SFI) is a cross-section predictive-importance (out-of-
sample) method. It computes the OOS performance score of each feature in isolation.
A few considerations:
1. This method can be applied to any classifier, not only tree-based classifiers.
2. SFI is not limited to accuracy as the sole performance score.
3. Unlike MDI and MDA, no substitution effects take place, since only one feature
is taken into consideration at a time.
4. Like MDA, it can conclude that all features are unimportant, because perfor-
mance is evaluated via OOS CV.


118
FEATURE IMPORTANCE
The main limitation of SFI is that a classifier with two features can perform better
than the bagging of two single-feature classifiers. For example, (1) feature B may be
useful only in combination with feature A; or (2) feature B may be useful in explain-
ing the splits from feature A, even if feature B alone is inaccurate. In other words,
joint effects and hierarchical importance are lost in SFI. One alternative would be
to compute the OOS performance score from subsets of features, but that calcula-
tion will become intractable as more features are considered. Snippet 8.4 demon-
strates one possible implementation of the SFI method. A discussion of the function
cvScore can be found in Chapter 7.

scoring=scoring,cvGen=cvGen)
imp.loc[featName,'mean']=df0.mean()
imp.loc[featName,'std']=df0.std()*df0.shape[0]**-.5
return imp
8.4.2
Orthogonal Features
As argued in Section 8.3, substitution effects dilute the importance of features mea-
sured by MDI, and significantly underestimate the importance of features measured
by MDA. A partial solution is to orthogonalize the features before applying MDI and
MDA. An orthogonalization procedure such as principal components analysis (PCA)
does not prevent all substitution effects, but at least it should alleviate the impact of
linear substitution effects.
Consider a matrix {Xt,n} of stationary features, with observations t = 1, … , T and
variables n = 1, … , N. First, we compute the standardized features matrix Z, such
that Zt,n = 𝜎−1
n (Xt,n −𝜇n), where 𝜇n is the mean of {Xt,n}t=1,…,T and 𝜎n is the standard
deviation of {Xt,n}t=1,…,T. Second, we compute the eigenvalues Λ and eigenvectors
W such that Z′ZW = WΛ, where Λ is an NxN diagonal matrix with main entries
sorted in descending order, and W is an NxN orthonormal matrix. Third, we derive
the orthogonal features as P = ZW. We can verify the orthogonality of the features
by noting that P′P = W′Z′ZW = W′WΛW′W = Λ.
The diagonalization is done on Z rather than X, for two reasons: (1) centering the
data ensures that the first principal component is correctly oriented in the main direc-
tion of the observations. It is equivalent to adding an intercept in a linear regression;
(2) re-scaling the data makes PCA focus on explaining correlations rather than vari-
ances. Without re-scaling, the first principal components would be dominated by the

119
columns of X with highest variance, and we would not learn much about the structure
or relationship between the variables.
Snippet 8.5 computes the smallest number of orthogonal features that explain at
least 95% of the variance of Z.

#3) reduce dimension, form PCs
cumVar=eVal.cumsum()/eVal.sum()
dim=cumVar.values.searchsorted(varThres)
eVal,eVec=eVal.iloc[:dim+1],eVec.iloc[:,:dim+1]
return eVal,eVec

def orthoFeats(dfX,varThres=.95):
# Given a dataframe dfX of features, compute orthofeatures dfP
dfZ=dfX.sub(dfX.mean(),axis=1).div(dfX.std(),axis=1) # standardize
dot=pd.DataFrame(np.dot(dfZ.T,dfZ),index=dfX.columns,columns=dfX.columns)
eVal,eVec=get_eVec(dot,varThres)
dfP=np.dot(dfZ,eVec)
return dfP
Besides addressing substitution effects, working with orthogonal features provides
two additional benefits: (1) orthogonalization can also be used to reduce the dimen-
sionality of the features matrix X, by dropping features associated with small eigen-
values. This usually speeds up the convergence of ML algorithms; (2) the analysis is
conducted on features designed to explain the structure of the data.
Let me stress this latter point. An ubiquitous concern throughout the book is the
risk of overfitting. ML algorithms will always find a pattern, even if that pattern is
a statistical fluke. You should always be skeptical about the purportedly important
features identified by any method, including MDI, MDA, and SFI. Now, suppose
that you derive orthogonal features using PCA. Your PCA analysis has determined
that some features are more “principal” than others, without any knowledge of the
labels (unsupervised learning). That is, PCA has ranked features without any possible
overfitting in a classification sense. When your MDI, MDA, or SFI analysis selects
as most important (using label information) the same features that PCA chose as


120

FIGURE 8.1
Scatter plot of eigenvalues (x-axis) and MDI levels (y-axis) in log-log scale
principal (ignoring label information), this constitutes confirmatory evidence that the
pattern identified by the ML algorithm is not entirely overfit. If the features were
entirely random, the PCA ranking would have no correspondance with the feature
importance ranking. Figure 8.1 displays the scatter plot of eigenvalues associated with
an eigenvector (x-axis) paired with MDI of the feature associated with an engenvector
(y-axis). The Pearson correlation is 0.8491 (p-value below 1E-150), evidencing that
PCA identified informative features and ranked them correctly without overfitting.
I find it useful to compute the weighted Kendall’s tau between the feature impor-
tances and their associated eigenvalues (or equivalently, their inverse PCA rank). The
closer this value is to 1, the stronger is the consistency between PCA ranking and fea-
ture importance ranking. One argument for preferring a weighted Kendall’s tau over
the standard Kendall is that we want to prioritize rank concordance among the most
importance features. We do not care so much about rank concordance among irrele-
vant (likely noisy) features. The hyperbolic-weighted Kendall’s tau for the sample in
Figure 8.1 is 0.8206.
Snippet 8.6 shows how to compute this correlation using Scipy. In this exam-
ple, sorting the features in descending importance gives us a PCA rank sequence
very close to an ascending list. Because the weightedtau function gives higher
weight to higher values, we compute the correlation on the inverse PCA ranking,
pcRank**-1. The resulting weighted Kendall’s tau is relatively high, at 0.8133.

8.5
PARALLELIZED VS. STACKED FEATURE IMPORTANCE
There are at least two research approaches to feature importance. First, for each secu-
rity i in an investment universe i = 1, … , I, we form a dataset (Xi, yi), and derive the
feature importance in parallel. For example, let us denote 𝜆i,j,k the importance of
feature j on instrument i according to criterion k. Then we can aggregate all results
across the entire universe to derive a combined Λj,k importance of feature j accord-
ing to criterion k. Features that are important across a wide variety of instruments are
more likely to be associated with an underlying phenomenon, particularly when these
feature importances exhibit high rank correlation across the criteria. It may be worth
studying in-depth the theoretical mechanism that makes these features predictive. The
main advantage of this approach is that it is computationally fast, as it can be paral-
lelized. A disadvantage is that, due to substitution effects, important features may
swap their ranks across instruments, increasing the variance of the estimated 𝜆i,j,k.
This disadvantage becomes relatively minor if we average 𝜆i,j,k across instruments
for a sufficiently large investment universe.
A second alternative is what I call “features stacking.” It consists in stacking all
datasets {( ̃Xi, yi)}i=1,…,I into a single combined dataset (X, y), where ̃Xi is a trans-
formed instance of Xi (e.g., standardized on a rolling trailing window). The purpose
of this transformation is to ensure some distributional homogeneity, ̃Xi ∼X. Under
this approach, the classifier must learn what features are more important across all
instruments simultaneously, as if the entire investment universe were in fact a single
instrument. Features stacking presents some advantages: (1) The classifier will be fit
on a much larger dataset than the one used with the parallelized (first) approach; (2)
the importance is derived directly, and no weighting scheme is required for combining
the results; (3) conclusions are more general and less biased by outliers or overfitting;
and (4) because importance scores are not averaged across instruments, substitution
effects do not cause the dampening of those scores.
I usually prefer features stacking, not only for features importance but whenever a
classifier can be fit on a set of instruments, including for the purpose of model predic-
tion. That reduces the likelihood of overfitting an estimator to a particular instrument
or small dataset. The main disadvantage of stacking is that it may consume a lot of

memory and resources, however that is where a sound knowledge of HPC techniques
will come in handy (Chapters 20–22).
8.6
EXPERIMENTS WITH SYNTHETIC DATA
In this section, we are going to test how these feature importance methods respond
to synthetic data. We are going to generate a dataset (X, y) composed on three kinds
of features:
1. Informative: These are features that are used to determine the label.
2. Redundant: These are random linear combinations of the informative features.
They will cause substitution effects.
3. Noise: These are features that have no bearing on determining the observation’s
label.
Snippet 8.7 shows how we can generate a synthetic dataset of 40 features
where 10 are informative, 10 are redundant, and 20 are noise, on 10,000 obser-
vations. For details on how sklearn generates synthetic datasets, visit: http://scikit-

FIGURE 8.2
MDI feature importance computed on a synthetic dataset
Figure 8.2 shows results for MDI. For each feature, the horizontal bar indicates
the mean MDI value across all the decision trees, and the horizontal line is the stan-
dard deviation of that mean. Since MDI importances add up to 1, if all features
were equally important, each importance would have a value of 1/40. The vertical
dotted line marks that 1/40 threshold, separating features whose importance exceeds
what would be expected from undistinguishable features. As you can see, MDI does
a very good job in terms of placing all informative and redundant features above the
dotted line, with the exception of R_5, which did not make the cut by a small
margin. Substitution effects cause some informative or redundant features to rank
better than others, which was expected.
Figure 8.3 shows that MDA also did a good job. Results are consistent with those
from MDI’s in the sense that all the informed and redundant features rank better than
the noise feature, with the exception of R_6, likely due to a substitution effect. One not
so positive aspect of MDA is that the standard deviation of the means are somewhat
higher, although that could be addressed by increasing the number of partitions in
the purged k-fold CV, from, say, 10 to 100 (at the cost of 10 × the computation time
without parallelization).
Figure 8.4 shows that SFI also does a decent job; however, a few important fea-
tures rank worse than noise (I_6, I_2, I_9, I_1, I_3, R_5), likely due to joint effects.

The labels are a function of a combination of features, and trying to forecast them
independently misses the joint effects. Still, SFI is useful as a complement to MDI
and MDA, precisely because both types of analyses are affected by different kinds of
problems.
EXERCISES
8.1 Using the code presented in Section 8.6:
(a) Generate a dataset (X, y).
(b) Apply a PCA transformation on X, which we denote ̇X.
(c) Compute MDI, MDA, and SFI feature importance on ( ̇X, y), where the base
estimator is RF.
(d) Do the three methods agree on what features are important? Why?
8.2 From exercise 1, generate a new dataset ( ̈X, y), where ̈X is a feature union of X
and ̇X.
(a) Compute MDI, MDA, and SFI feature importance on ( ̈X, y), where the base
estimator is RF.
(b) Do the three methods agree on the important features? Why?
8.3 Take the results from exercise 2:
(a) Drop the most important features according to each method, resulting in a
features matrix ⃛X.
(b) Compute MDI, MDA, and SFI feature importance on (⃛X, y), where the base
estimator is RF.
(c) Do you appreciate significant changes in the rankings of important features,
relative to the results from exercise 2?
8.4 Using the code presented in Section 8.6:
(a) Generate a dataset (X, y) of 1E6 observations, where 5 features are informa-
tive, 5 are redundant and 10 are noise.
(b) Split (X, y) into 10 datasets {(Xi, yi)}i=1,…,10, each of 1E5 observations.
(c) Compute the parallelized feature importance (Section 8.5), on each of the 10
datasets, {(Xi, yi)}i=1,…,10.
(d) Compute the stacked feature importance on the combined dataset (X, y).
(e) What causes the discrepancy between the two? Which one is more reliable?
8.5 Repeat all MDI calculations from exercises 1–4, but this time allow for masking
effects. That means, do not set max_features=int(1) in Snippet 8.2. How do
results differ as a consequence of this change? Why?
