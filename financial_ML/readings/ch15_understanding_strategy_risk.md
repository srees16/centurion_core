# Chapter 15: Understanding Strategy Risk


CHAPTER 15
Understanding Strategy Risk
15.1
MOTIVATION
As we saw in Chapters 3 and 13, investment strategies are often implemented in terms
of positions held until one of two conditions are met: (1) a condition to exit the posi-
tion with profits (profit-taking), or (2) a condition to exit the position with losses (stop-
loss). Even when a strategy does not explicitly declare a stop-loss, there is always
an implicit stop-loss limit, at which the investor can no longer finance her position
(margin call) or bear the pain caused by an increasing unrealized loss. Because most
strategies have (implicitly or explicitly) these two exit conditions, it makes sense to
model the distribution of outcomes through a binomial process. This in turn will help
us understand what combinations of betting frequency, odds, and payouts are uneco-
nomic. The goal of this chapter is to help you evaluate when a strategy is vulnerable
to small changes in any of these variables.
15.2
SYMMETRIC PAYOUTS
Consider a strategy that produces n IID bets per year, where the outcome Xi of a
bet i ∈[1, n] is a profit 𝜋> 0 with probability P[Xi = 𝜋] = p, and a loss −𝜋with
probability P[Xi = −𝜋] = 1 −p. You can think of p as the precision of a binary
classifier where a positive means betting on an opportunity, and a negative means
passing on an opportunity: True positives are rewarded, false positives are pun-
ished, and negatives (whether true or false) have no payout. Since the betting out-
comes {Xi}i=1,…,n are independent, we will compute the expected moments per
bet. The expected profit from one bet is E[Xi] = 𝜋p + (−𝜋)(1 −p) = 𝜋(2p −1). The
variance is V[Xi] = E[X2
i ] −E[Xi]2, where E[X2
i ] = 𝜋2p + (−𝜋)2(1 −p) = 𝜋2, thus

UNDERSTANDING STRATEGY RISK
V[Xi] = 𝜋2 −𝜋2(2p −1)2 = 𝜋2[1 −(2p −1)2] = 4𝜋2p(1 −p). For n IID bets per
year, the annualized Sharpe ratio (𝜃) is

Note how 𝜋cancels out of the above equation, because the payouts are symmet-
ric. Just as in the Gaussian case, 𝜃[p, n] can be understood as a re-scaled t-value.
This illustrates the point that, even for a small p > 1
2, the Sharpe ratio can be made
high for a sufficiently large n. This is the economic basis for high-frequency trading,
where p can be barely above .5, and the key to a successful business is to increase
n. The Sharpe ratio is a function of precision rather than accuracy, because passing
on an opportunity (a negative) is not rewarded or punished directly (although too
many negatives may lead to a small n, which will depress the Sharpe ratio toward
zero).
For example, for p = .55,
2p−1

√
p(1−p) = 0.1005, and achieving an annualized Sharpe
ratio of 2 requires 396 bets per year. Snippet 15.1 verifies this result experimen-
tally. Figure 15.1 plots the Sharpe ratio as a function of precision, for various betting
frequencies.

This equation makes explicit the trade-off between precision (p) and frequency
(n) for a given Sharpe ratio (𝜃). For example, a strategy that only produces weekly
bets (n = 52) will need a fairly high precision of p = 0.6336 to deliver an annualized
Sharpe of 2.
15.3
ASYMMETRIC PAYOUTS
Consider a strategy that produces n IID bets per year, where the outcome Xi
of a bet i ∈[1, n] is 𝜋+ with probability P[Xi = 𝜋+] = p, and an outcome 𝜋−,
𝜋−< 𝜋+ occurs with probability P[Xi = 𝜋−] = 1 −p. The expected profit from
one bet is E[Xi] = p𝜋+ + (1 −p)𝜋−= (𝜋+ −𝜋−)p + 𝜋−. The variance is V[Xi] =
E[X2
i ] −E[Xi]2, where E[X2
i ] = p𝜋2

>>> m1=p*u+(1-p)*d
>>> v=m2-m1**2
>>> factor(v)
The above equation answers the following question: Given a trading rule charac-
terized by parameters {𝜋−, 𝜋+, n}, what is the precision rate p required to achieve a
Sharpe ratio of 𝜃∗? For example, for n = 260, 𝜋−= −.01, 𝜋+ = .005, in order to get
𝜃= 2 we require a p = .72. Thanks to the large number of bets, a very small change
in p (from p = .7 to p = .72) has propelled the Sharpe ratio from 𝜃= 1.173 to 𝜃= 2.
On the other hand, this also tells us that the strategy is vulnerable to small changes in
p. Snippet 15.3 implements the derivation of the implied precision. Figure 15.2 dis-
plays the implied precision as a function of n and 𝜋−, where 𝜋+ = 0.1 and 𝜃∗= 1.5.
As 𝜋−becomes more negative for a given n, a higher p is required to achieve 𝜃∗for
a given 𝜋+. As n becomes smaller for a given 𝜋−, a higher p is required to achieve 𝜃∗
for a given 𝜋+.

THE PROBABILITY OF STRATEGY FAILURE
In the example above, parameters 𝜋−= −.01, 𝜋+ = .005 are set by the portfolio man-
ager, and passed to the traders with the execution orders. Parameter n = 260 is also set
by the portfolio manager, as she decides what constitutes an opportunity worth bet-
ting on. The two parameters that are not under the control of the portfolio manager
are p (determined by the market) and 𝜃∗(the objective set by the investor). Because
p is unknown, we can model it as a random variable, with expected value E [p]. Let
us define p𝜃∗as the value of p below which the strategy will underperform a target
Sharpe ratio 𝜃∗, that is, p𝜃∗= max{p|𝜃≤𝜃∗}. We can use the equations above (or the
binHR function) to conclude that for p𝜃∗=0 = 2
3, p < p𝜃∗=0 ⇒𝜃≤0. This highlights

the risks involved in this strategy, because a relatively small drop in p (from p = .7
to p = .67) will wipe out all the profits. The strategy is intrinsically risky, even if the
holdings are not. That is the critical difference we wish to establish with this chapter:
Strategy risk should not be confused with portfolio risk.
Most firms and investors compute, monitor, and report portfolio risk without real-
izing that this tells us nothing about the risk of the strategy itself. Strategy risk is not
the risk of the underlying portfolio, as computed by the chief risk officer. Strategy risk
is the risk that the investment strategy will fail to succeed over time, a question of far
greater relevance to the chief investment officer. The answer to the question “What
is the probability that this strategy will fail?” is equivalent to computing P[p < p𝜃∗].
The following algorithm will help us compute the strategy risk.
15.4.1
Algorithm
In this section we will describe a procedure to compute P[p < p𝜃∗]. Given a time
series of bet outcomes {𝜋t}t=1,…,T, first we estimate 𝜋−= E[{𝜋t|𝜋t ≤0}t=1,…,T], and
𝜋+ = E[{𝜋t|𝜋t > 0}t=1,…,T]. Alternatively, {𝜋−, 𝜋+} could be derived from fitting a
mixture of two Gaussians, using the EF3M algorithm (L´opez de Prado and Foreman
[2014]). Second, the annual frequency n is given by n = T
y , where y is the number of
years elapsed between t = 1 and t = T. Third, we bootstrap the distribution of p as
follows:
1. For iterations i = 1, … , I:
(a) Draw ⌊nk⌋samples from {𝜋t}t=1,…,T with replacement, where k is the num-
ber of years used by investors to assess a strategy (e.g., 2 years). We denote
the set of these drawn samples as {𝜋(i)
j }j=1,…,⌊nk⌋.
(b) Derive
the
observed
precision
from
iteration
i
as
pi =
1
⌊nk⌋‖{𝜋(i)
j |𝜋(i)
j
> 0}j=1,…,⌊nk⌋‖.
2. Fit the PDF of p, denoted f[p], by applying a Kernel Density Estimator (KDE)
on {pi}i=1,…,I.
For a sufficiently large k, we can approximate this third step as f[p] ∼
N[̄p, ̄p(1 −̄p)], where ̄p = E[p] = 1
T ‖{𝜋(i)
t |𝜋(i)
t
> 0}t=1,…,T‖. Fourth, given a thresh-
old 𝜃∗(the Sharpe ratio that separates failure from success), derive p𝜃∗(see Sec-
tion 15.4). Fifth, the strategy risk is computed as P[p < p𝜃∗] = ∫p𝜃∗
−∞f[p]dp.
15.4.2
Implementation
Snippet 15.5 lists one possible implementation of this algorithm. Typically we would
disregard strategies where P[p < p𝜃∗] > .05 as too risky, even if they invest in low
volatility instruments. The reason is that even if they do not lose much money, the
probability that they will fail to achieve their target is too high. In order to be deployed,
the strategy developer must find a way to reduce p𝜃∗.

This approach shares some similarities with PSR (see Chapter 14, and Bailey and
L´opez de Prado [2012, 2014]). PSR derives the probability that the true Sharpe ratio
exceeds a given threshold under non-Gaussian returns. Similarly, the method intro-
duced in this chapter derives the strategy’s probability of failure based on asymmetric
binary outcomes. The key difference is that, while PSR does not distinguish between
parameters under or outside the portfolio manager’s control, the method discussed
here allows the portfolio manager to study the viability of the strategy subject to the
parameters under her control: {𝜋−, 𝜋+, n}. This is useful when designing or assessing
the viability of a trading strategy.


EXERCISES

EXERCISES
15.1 A portfolio manager intends to launch a strategy that targets an annualized SR of
2. Bets have a precision rate of 60%, with weekly frequency. The exit conditions
are 2% for profit-taking, and –2% for stop-loss.
(a) Is this strategy viable?
(b) Ceteris paribus, what is the required precision rate that would make the
strategy profitable?
(c) For what betting frequency is the target achievable?
(d) For what profit-taking threshold is the target achievable?
(e) What would be an alternative stop-loss?
15.2 Following up on the strategy from exercise 1.
(a) What is the sensitivity of SR to a 1% change in each parameter?
(b) Given these sensitivities, and assuming that all parameters are equally hard
to improve, which one offers the lowest hanging fruit?
(c) Does changing any of the parameters in exercise 1 impact the others? For
example, does changing the betting frequency modify the precision rate,
etc.?
15.3 Suppose a strategy that generates monthly bets over two years, with returns
following a mixture of two Gaussian distributions. The first distribution has
a mean of –0.1 and a standard deviation of 0.12. The second distribution has
a mean of 0.06 and a standard deviation of 0.03. The probability that a draw
comes from the first distribution is 0.15.
(a) Following L´opez de Prado and Peijan [2004] and L´opez de Prado and Fore-
man [2014], derive the first four moments for the mixture’s returns.
(b) What is the annualized SR?
(c) Using those moments, compute PSR[1] (see Chapter 14). At a 95% confi-
dence level, would you discard this strategy?
15.4 Using Snippet 15.5, compute P[p < p𝜃∗=1] for the strategy described in exercise
3. At a significance level of 0.05, would you discard this strategy? Is this result
consistent with PSR[𝜃∗]?
15.5 In general, what result do you expect to be more accurate, PSR[𝜃∗] or
P[p < p𝜃∗=1]? How are these two methods complementary?
15.6 Re-examine the results from Chapter 13, in light of what you have learned in
this chapter.
(a) Does the asymmetry between profit taking and stop-loss thresholds in OTRs
make sense?
(b) What is the range of p implied by Figure 13.1, for a daily betting frequency?
(c) What is the range of p implied by Figure 13.5, for a weekly betting fre-
quency?
