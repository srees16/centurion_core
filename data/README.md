# Data Directory

This directory is used for persistent storage when running in Docker containers.

## Purpose
- Stores output files (Excel/CSV) generated by the application
- Mounted as a Docker volume to persist data across container restarts
- Keeps data separate from the application code

## Docker Volume Mounting

The `docker-compose.yml` and deployment scripts mount this directory:
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./data:/app/data
```

## Usage

When running in Docker, configure the application to save files to `/app/data/` directory.

Files saved here will persist on your host machine even after container stops or restarts.
