"""
EWMAC Trading Rule — Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Crossover.

Implements Carver's primary momentum rule (Appendix B).  For each
look-back pair (fast, slow), the raw signal is:

    raw_crossover = EWMA(close, fast) - EWMA(close, slow)

This is then volatility-adjusted and scaled to produce a forecast
with an expected average absolute value of ≈ 10, capped at ±20.

Recommended variations for swing / positional trading:
  - EWMAC(16, 64)   — captures 3–10 day swings        (swing core)
  - EWMAC(32, 128)  — captures 2–4 week trends         (positional core)
  - EWMAC(64, 256)  — captures 1–3 month macro trends  (positional slow)

Faster variations (2/8, 4/16, 8/32) are excluded because NSE
equity CNC trades have too-high costs for sub-weekly turnover.

AFTS Enhancements:
  - S12 (Adjusted Trend): For slow filters (64,256), cap raw forecast at
    ±15 then multiply by 1.25.  Large slow forecasts are usually driven by
    low-vol environments, not genuinely strong trends, so this cap-and-scale
    improves the forecast distribution and raises SR by ~0.02.
  - S17 (Normalised Trend): Maps the EWMAC forecast to its percentile rank
    within its own history.  Produces a uniform forecast distribution — more
    robust across regimes and avoids extreme forecasts in trending markets.
